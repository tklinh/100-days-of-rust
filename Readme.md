<h1 align="center">100 days of Rust</h1>

This repository will be used to record the daily work that tracks my progress in the challenge ***100 days of Rust***.

I do not set any strict goal for this challenge because I think it's happier to discover :telescope: the goal during the progress.

:rainbow: Let's rock it! :rocket:

* Test the Rust installation:
  
        rustc --version
